**1. [cite\_start]Overview** [cite: 6]

[cite\_start]This paper details a sophisticated algorithm for seamlessly placing a person and their cast shadow into a different background image. [cite: 7] [cite\_start]To achieve a photorealistic outcome, the method emphasizes the in-depth analysis and synchronization of lighting, shadows, and color tones between the person (source) and the new background (target). [cite: 8] [cite\_start]Every stage of this process is crafted to overcome significant hurdles in image composition, aiming for a physically believable and visually persuasive final image rather than a mere cutout. [cite: 9]

**2. [cite\_start]Step 1: Isolating the Person and Shadow** [cite: 10]

[cite\_start]The first and most vital step involves separating the individual from their original setting while meticulously retaining their shadow. [cite: 11] [cite\_start]Conventional methods for background removal often eliminate shadows, which are crucial for anchoring an object within its surroundings. [cite: 12] [cite\_start]The proposed technique guarantees that both the person and their shadow are preserved. [cite: 13]

**Process:**

  * [cite\_start]**AI-Based Segmentation:** An artificial intelligence tool is employed to precisely create an initial mask of the person. [cite: 15]
  * [cite\_start]**Shadow Mask Creation:** A distinct mask for the shadow is produced by using adaptive thresholding and morphological operations on the source image to isolate dark areas attached to the person's outline. [cite: 16]
  * [cite\_start]**Unified Output:** The person mask is merged with the shadow mask to form a single foreground layer that contains both the subject and their original shadow. [cite: 17]

[cite\_start]**Outcome:** The result is a prepared foreground layer with the person and their complete shadow, ready for subsequent integration. [cite: 18]

**3. [cite\_start]Step 2: Analyzing the New Background Scene** [cite: 19]

[cite\_start]A detailed examination of the target background's lighting and shadow characteristics is necessary before merging the elements. [cite: 20] [cite\_start]This analysis ensures that the placed person and their shadow will align with the new environment's existing conditions. [cite: 21]

**Process:**

  * [cite\_start]**Shadow Identification:** The new background image is assessed to identify all present shadows. [cite: 23] [cite\_start]To enhance the precision of shadow identification, the image is transformed into the LAB color space. [cite: 24]
  * [cite\_start]**Shadow Categorization:** Identified shadows are categorized according to the nature of their edges. [cite: 25] [cite\_start]Well-defined edges suggest hard shadows, which are cast by a direct and concentrated light source, whereas soft shadows, indicated by gradual and indistinct edges, originate from diffused or ambient lighting. [cite: 26]

[cite\_start]**Outcome:** This step yields a thorough comprehension of the target scene's lighting, which guides how the new shadow should be rendered. [cite: 27]

**4. [cite\_start]Step 3: Triangulating the Light Source** [cite: 28]

[cite\_start]To cast a shadow realistically, it is essential to establish the direction and strength of the main light source(s) in both the original and the new environments. [cite: 29]

**Process:**

  * [cite\_start]**Vector-Based Analysis:** In images where shadows are distinct, the light source's direction is approximated by examining the vector from an object's base to its shadow's tip. [cite: 31]
  * [cite\_start]**Brightness-Based Analysis:** When clear shadows are absent, a quadrant-based analysis of brightness is performed to estimate the approximate direction of the main light source. [cite: 32]
  * [cite\_start]**Intensity Calculation:** The light's strength is deduced by comparing the brightness of illuminated surfaces with that of shaded regions. [cite: 33]

[cite\_start]**Outcome:** The process provides a specific light direction angle and intensity measurement for both images, enabling a precise adjustment of the person's shadow. [cite: 34]

**5. [cite\_start]Step 4: Harmonizing Color and Blending** [cite: 35]

[cite\_start]Simply pasting the person into the new scene would create a jarring and artificial-looking disparity in color and tone. [cite: 36] [cite\_start]This stage synchronizes the foreground element with the background to produce a seamless composition. [cite: 37]

**Process:**

  * [cite\_start]**Statistical Color Matching:** Using the Reinhard color transfer algorithm within the LAB color space, the color profile of the extracted person is modified to align with the background's statistical color attributes (mean and standard deviation). [cite: 39]
  * [cite\_start]**Histogram Alignment:** The tonal range of the foreground is adjusted to match the background's histogram, ensuring a consistent distribution of tones. [cite: 40]
  * [cite\_start]**Brightness Calibration:** The person's overall brightness is adjusted to correspond with the light intensity of the new background. [cite: 41]

[cite\_start]**Outcome:** The color and lighting of the person are re-calibrated, making them appear as a natural component of the new scene. [cite: 42]

**6. [cite\_start]Step 5: Finalizing the Composite and Making Refinements** [cite: 43]

[cite\_start]The last stage consists of inserting the color-corrected person and their modified shadow into the background, followed by meticulous adjustments to perfect the integration. [cite: 44]

**Process:**

  * [cite\_start]**Shadow Adjustment and Positioning:** The original shadow is geometrically altered (rotated, scaled, and skewed) to align with the light direction identified in Step 3. [cite: 46] [cite\_start]Its transparency and blurriness are modified to match the characteristics (hard vs. soft) of the shadows in the background. [cite: 46]
  * [cite\_start]**Ideal Placement:** Adjustments are made to the scale and position to determine the most natural-looking placement of the person in the scene. [cite: 47]
  * [cite\_start]**Edge Feathering:** To eliminate sharp, unnatural-looking outlines, a feathered mask is applied to the edges of the person and shadow by using a Gaussian blur, which softens their transition into the background. [cite: 48]
  * [cite\_start]**Generating the Final Image:** All layers are combined to create the finished, photorealistic picture. [cite: 49]

[cite\_start]**Outcome:** The final product is a high-quality composite image in which the individual and their shadow are convincingly integrated into the new setting. [cite: 50]
